# Tree-walking Interpreter #

## Lexical Analysis ## 
Lexical analysis or lexing transoforms source code to tokens. 
Tokens are small, easily categorizable data structures that are fed to the parser.
Then the parser performs a second transofrmation and turns the token into an *"Abstract Syntax Tree"*
